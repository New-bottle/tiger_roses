1.分析你所建立的模型执行结果和优缺点
 2.Analyze and interpret the results of your model to address the four states’ usage of cleaner, renewable energy sources in a way that is easily understood by the governors and helps them to understand the similarities and difference between the four states. Include in your discussion possible influential factors of the similarities and differences (e.g. geography, industry, population, and climate).
 以容易理解的语言向政府解释你的模型对于这四个州对于绿色可再生能源的分析结果，并且说明这四个州用能方面的相似点和不同点。对于什么造成了这些相似点和不同点，给出你的猜测
 3.Determine which of the four states appeared to have the “best” profile for use of cleaner, renewable energy in 2009. Explain your criteria and choice.  
 指出这四个州哪一个州对于绿色可再生能源的利用最理想，并给出你的评判标准和选择这个州的原因
  4.Based on the historical evolution of energy use in these states, and your understanding of the differences between the state profiles you established, predict the energy profile of each state, as you have defined it, for 2025 and 2050 in the absence of any policy changes by each governor’s office.
根据这些州的用能在历史上的变迁和你对于它们用能曲线差异的理解，预测这些州在2025和2050年的用能结构
