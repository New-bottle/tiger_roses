Energy sources can be categorized as renewable and non-renewable sources:
Non-Renewable Sources
Fossil fuels:
•	 coal (CL)
•	 net imports of coal coke (U.S. only)
•	 natural gas excluding supplemental gaseous fuels (NN)
•	 petroleum products excluding fuel ethanol blended into motor gasoline
(PM)
Nuclear electric power (NU)
Renewable Sources
•	 fuel ethanol minus denaturant (EM)
•	 geothermal direct use energy and geothermal heat pumps (GE)
•	 conventional hydroelectric power (HY)
•	 solar thermal direct use energy and photovoltaic electricity net
generation (SO)
•	 electricity produced by wind (WY)
•	 wood and wood-derived fuels (WD)
•	 biomass waste (WS) 

1. 
FFTCBZZ = CLTCBZZ + NNTCBZZ + PMTCBZZ
FFTCBUS = CLTCBUS + CCNIBUS + NNTCBUS + PMTCBUS

fossil fuels total consumption = coal total consumption + natural gas total consumption (excluding supplemental gaseous fuels) + All petroleum products total consumption excluding fuel ethanol

2. 
NUETBZZ

nuclear power

3.
RETCBZZ = EMTCBZZ + GETCBZZ + HYTCBZZ + SOTCBZZ + WYTCBZZ + BMTCBZZ

renewable energy total comsumption = fuel ethanol, excluding denaturant, total consumption + geothermal energy total consumption + hydroelectricity total production + photovoltaic and solar thermal energy total consumption + electricity produced from wind energy + biomass total consumption

4. 
TETCBZZ = FFTCBZZ + NUETBZZ + RETCBZZ + ELNIBZZ + ELISBZZ
TETCBUS = FFTCBUS + NUETBUS + RETCBUS + ELNIBUS

total energy = fossil fuels + nuclear power + renueable energy + net imports of electricity + Net interstate sales of electricity and associated losses (negative and positive values).
